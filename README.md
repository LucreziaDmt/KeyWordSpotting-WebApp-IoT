# KeyWordSpotting-WebApp-IoT
In this simple project I developed a web application and a client (the raspberryPi) in order to recognize some keywords ('no','yes','down','up','go','left','right').
In the main.py file there is the code to train various models, that will be used by the webserver to recognize the word, a word that can is recorded by the client
and sent to the WebServer.
