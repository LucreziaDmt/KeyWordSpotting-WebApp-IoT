# KeyWordSpotting-WebApp-IoT
In this simple project I developed a web application and a client application (running on the raspberryPi) in order to recognize some keywords ('no','yes','down','up','go','left','right').
In the main.py file there is the code to train various models, that will be used by the webserver to recognize words. Keywords are recorded on the client
and sent to the WebServer.
